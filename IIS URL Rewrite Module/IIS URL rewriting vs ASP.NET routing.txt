### IIS URL rewriting vs ASP.NET routing ###

Differences:
------------
* request-processing pipeline:
  rewriter - plugs into the request-processing pipeline at the 'Begin Request' stage, before the request is handled by the Web server.
  routing - plugs at 'Resolve Cache' (PostResolveRequestCache) and 'Map Handler' (PostMapRequestHandler) stages, executes at 'execute Handler' stage

* process:
  rewriter - each rewrite rule match the requested url changes it to a new defined url within the same server 
  routing - (PostResolveRequestCache) each route in the routing table match the requested url obtain a reference to the route defined handler and added to the request context
		    remark: an handler can be any object implements the 'System.Web.IHttpHandler' interface
			(PostMapRequestHandler) mark the handlers to execute based on the references from the previous stage 
			(execute Handler) execute the handlers 

* handlers recognition:
  rewriter - does not know which handler will process the rewritten URL
  routing - knows about the handlers, executes the handler that should generate a response for the requested URL

* supported applications:
  rewriter - can be used with any type of Web application (ASP.NET, PHP, ASP etc.) and static files (css, images etc.)
  routing - can be used only with .NET Web applications.

* IIS pipeline mode:
  rewriter - can used both integrated or classic IIS pipeline mode for the application pool
  routing - works with integrated mode (not recommended to work with classic mode due to adjustments needed to be made)

* rewriting elements:
  rewriter - can make rewriting based on domain names, HTTP headers, and server variables.
  routing - can work only with URL paths and HTTP-Method header 

* additional tasks:
  rewriter - in addition to the rewriting action, it can perform HTTP redirection, custom status codes and abort requests
  routing - does not perform the additional tasks mentioned above

* extensibility:
  rewriter - not extensible.
  routing -  fully extensible and customizable.

Which Option to Use:
--------------------
* for non .Net applications - you must use rewriter 

* for new ASP.NET MVC applications - use the routing module 

* for existing .Net applications you should use rewriter
