IIS 7 FAILED REQUEST TRACING(FRT) 
=================================
* alias : FRT 
* FRT can be used with the URL rewrite module to trace how rewrite rules were applied to the request URL

installation:
-------------
* control panel -> programs -> add features -> IIS -> WWWServices -> diagnostic -> Tracing

using:
------
* choose the site you want to trace
* configure tab (in the right pane) -> failed Request Tracing
* check the 'Enable' checkbox and set the trace log file 

* double click on the FRT icon -> add
* choose 'All content' radio -> next 
  set the status codes range to trace -> next
  check only 'WWW Server' and uncheck the rest -> check only 'Rewrite' and uncheck the rest -> finish

notice:
if you can't find 'Rewrite' checkbox its because the FRT installed after the Rewrite module
to solve this issue go to Add/Remove programs and then run 'IIS URL rewrite module' in repair mode
