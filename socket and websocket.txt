socket and websocket
--------------------

WebSockets typically run from browsers connecting to Application Server 
over a protocol similar to HTTP that runs over TCP/IP. 
they are primarily for Web Applications that require a permanent connection to its server. 

plain sockets are more powerful and generic. 
They run over TCP/IP but they are not restricted to browsers or HTTP protocol. 
They could be used to implement any kind of communication.
