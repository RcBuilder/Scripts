preload link - css, js and other resources
------------------------------------------
used for improving the page load velocity.  
this keyword signal the browser to download this resource as soon as possible.  
very handy in cases where a file might block the DOM rendering if it hasn't loaded prior to the render step.

important! 
the 'preload' and 'prefetch' keywords only fetch the resource without applying it! 
it stores it in memory and applies when it reaches the resource declaration.

<link rel="preload" href="some-script" as="script">
...
...
<script>
  var script = document.createElement('script');
  script.src = 'some-script.js';
  document.body.appendChild(script);
</script>
...
...

-

supports:
style
script 
font
image
media
document

-

using:
<head>
  <link rel="preload" as="font"   href="font.woff2">
  <link rel="preload" as="style"  href="styles.css">
  <link rel="preload" as="script" href="site.js">
</head>

-

prefetch: 
there is also the 'prefetch' keyword which is similar to the 'preload' but with lower priority.

-

case sample:
lets say we have an 'index.html' page that calls 'app.js' file which dynamically downloads 'styles.css' and 'ui.js'  files. 
in this case, these 'styles.css' and 'ui.js' files will be requested and rendered only after the 'app.js' has been downloaded, parsed, and executed! 
(in the Waterfall tab you'll see that they start their work only after 'app.js' was completed) 

index.html
| -- app.js
     | -- styles.css
     | -- site.js	 

by using the following links in the page head, these files will be pre-downloaded 
without waiting for the app.js to complete its processing: 
<link rel="preload" as="style"  href="styles.css">
<link rel="preload" as="script" href="site.js">
