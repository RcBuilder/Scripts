What is SOAP ?
--------------

* SOAP = Simple Object Access Protocol.
* SOAP is a communication protocol.
* the soap protocol usually uses the HTTP protocol but can use other protocols such as TCP.
* SOAP is a way to transfer data between applications that not necessarily from same types (C# can talk with java etc.)
* SOAP transfers the data as XML structure.
* SOAP is a format for sending messages.
* SOAP specifies exactly how the data should be transfered between the applications (schema based).  
* SOAP uses Syntax Rules (see below)
* SOAP was developed by Microsoft.
* a great advantage of SOAP is that it uses the HTTP protocol which usually firewall opens so it is accessible. 
* SOAP exposes WSDL, WSDL defines contract between the client and the service, it is a static contract.
* SOAP describes functions and types of data. 

SOAP Syntax Rules
-----------------

* a SOAP message MUST be encoded using XML.
* a SOAP message MUST use the SOAP Envelope namespace.
* a SOAP message MUST use the SOAP Encoding namespace.
* a SOAP message MUST NOT contain a DTD reference.
* a SOAP message MUST NOT contain XML Processing Instructions.

REST vs WCF
-----------

* REST based on the HTTP protocol, WCF based on SOAP (that is also based on the HTTP).
* both are communication technologies.
* the REST contract between the client and the server is dynamic and can changed per request, the WSDL is static. 
* REST is very lightweight in contrast to the complexity that SOAP creates.
* it's easier to work with REST than WCF. 
* REST embraces the HTTP protocol perfectly so we can use all of its CRUD methods (PUT, POST, GET, DELETE), WCF usually works with POST.
* unitests are much easier with REST, we only need an explorer. we can use fiddler to test it directly.
* REST is dynamic with no schema, WCF generates a proxy with a specific schema.
* we can pass/receive json, xml, binary or plain text via REST, WCF returns a structured objects and using an XML to transfer the data.
* REST always uses HTTP protocol, WCF can use other protocols such as TCP.
* any schema change in WCF forces a service update in order to update the local proxy.
* REST is more flexible, WCF must follow some rules.
* REST api can be reached from any source supports HTTP, therefore, we can access REST api via ajax calls from javascript, 
  due to the JSON return type capability, REST blended naturally in the javascript.     
* when using REST, the client defines the return type to receive (XML, JSON etc.), therefore, we can use the same api for different types.
