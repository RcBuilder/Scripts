Entity Framework EF - Disposed Context BugFix
---------------------------------------------
error:
The ObjectContext instance has been disposed and can no longer be used for operations that require a connection.

cause:
EF uses lazy loading to fetch the data, once connection is closed (also by using statement) - the data is NOT reachable!

solution:
disable 'LazyLoadingEnabled' feature of the context configuration

code:
using (var context = new Entities.OpenBookDBContext()) {
	context.Configuration.LazyLoadingEnabled = false;
	...
	...
}
