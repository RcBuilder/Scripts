Android Debug Bridge (ADB)
--------------------------
this tool is used for any communication with a device.  

file adb.exe.
this tool is provided in the android SDK. 
located within the %ANDROID_HOME%\platform-tools folder in the SDK.

it is a client-server program with 3 components: 
- an adb client
- an adb server
- an adb deamon

using port: 
the server listens on port 5037. 
the client uses this port to send commands.

USB debugging:
to use adb with a physical device connected via USB, we must enable the USB debugging feature.
System Settings > Developer options > USB debugging.

Tip:
add the android tools and platform-tools to the 'PATH' environment variable so we could access them from anywhere!
environment variables > Path > add > 'E:\Android SDK\sdk\platform-tools'
