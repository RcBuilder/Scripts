Mutex using Sample
------------------

using System.Threading;

static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var mutex = new Mutex(false, "sample_mutex_key");

            mutex.WaitOne(); // enter the mutex scope

            Console.WriteLine("working ....");
            Thread.Sleep(5000);

            Console.WriteLine("press to release");
            Console.ReadKey();

            mutex.ReleaseMutex(); // exit the mutex scope
        }

---

System-wide!  
in the example above, Only a single thread/ process could enter the mutex scope at any given moment! 
other processes will have to wait till one leaves the mutex scope.

test: 
1. build project a duplicate the execution file twice
2. (try to) execute them all together 
3. the first one will be executed and enter the mutex scope whereas the second one will wait 
   till the first one releases the mutex.
