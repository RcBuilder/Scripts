Cancel Event in Console Application
-----------------------------------
use this technique to cancel and close the app with an event. 
use the CTRL + BREAK or CTRL + C hotkeys to trigger the CANCEL event which then triggers the EXIT event!

note!
we can also use HotKeys to trigger events based on keys combination: 
see 'Global HotKeys in Console Application'

class Program
{
    static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {        
        ITradeBot tradeBot = new DummyBot();

        AppDomain.CurrentDomain.ProcessExit += (s, e) => {
            Console.WriteLine("EXIT EVENT WAS TRIGGERED!");
            (tradeBot as IDisposable)?.Dispose();               
        };
            
        Console.CancelKeyPress += (s, e) => {
            Console.WriteLine("CANCEL EVENT WAS TRIGGERED!");
            Environment.Exit(0);  // close app + trigger the ProcessExit event
        };

        try
        {
			...
			...
            await tradeBot.Run();
			...
			...
        }
        catch (Exception ex) {
            Console.WriteLine($"UNHANDLED EXCEPTION {ex.Message}");
        }
        finally
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Press any key to exit");
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

public class DummyBot : ITradeBot, IDisposable {
	public void Dispose() {
        Console.WriteLine($"DISPOSING {this.GetType().Name}");
    }

	public async Task<bool> Run() { ... }
}
