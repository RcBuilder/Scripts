same origin policy
------------------
What is "Same Origin"?
Two URLs have the same origin if they have identical schemes, hosts, and ports. (RFC 6454)

These two URLs have the same origin:
http://example.com/foo.html
http://example.com/bar.html

These URLs have different origins than the previous two:
http://example.net - Different domain
http://example.com:9000/foo.html - Different port
https://example.com/foo.html - Different scheme
http://www.example.com/foo.html - Different subdomain
