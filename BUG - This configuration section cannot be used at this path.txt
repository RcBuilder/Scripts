Bug:
Config Error
This configuration section cannot be used at this path

Error:
This configuration section cannot be used at this path. 
This happens when the section is locked at a parent level. 
Locking is either by default (overrideModeDefault="Deny"), 
or set explicitly by a location tag with overrideMode="Deny" or the legacy allowOverride="false".

Cause:
missing windows features

Solution:
(steps)
1. go to 'Turn windows features on or off'
2. choose 'Internet Information Services'
3. chose 'World Wide Web Services'
4. choose 'Application Development Features' > enable.
