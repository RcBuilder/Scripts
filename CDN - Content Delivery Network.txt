CDN = Content Delivery Network
------------------------------
a global network which hosts static files such as scripts, css and more.. 
servers that deployed all over the globe and give us access to files.

pros:

* caching
  if we refer to the CDN 'jquery.js' file (e.g), there's a good chance that other sites do that as well 
  so when user arrives to our site it may already has downloaded this file from other site he visited in 
  so it will not be downloaded again and the browser will use the user local copy.
  less files to download!
 
* speed
  due to multiple servers deployed all over - our file will be downloaded 
  from the nearest geo-location to the user station. 
  if a user located in india requests the file, he will get it from a server located in india 
  instead of from our server that can be located far away.

* network traffic
  reduces the network traffic to our web server.
  the files download from the CDN servers instead of reaching our servers.
   
* parallelism
  each browser can make x concurrent requests in parallel per domain. 
  by adding more servers (more hosts), we increase the parallelism downloads capabillity.

cons: 

* dependency
  if a CDN server is down - the files will not be downloaded and our site will not work properly.

  tip! 
  we can overcome this issue by creating a fallback of the loaded script into a local copy
  
  window.JQuery || document.write('<script src="scripts/jquery.js">\x3C/script>');
