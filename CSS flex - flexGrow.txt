css flexGrow
determines the remaining space distribution between the items. not their ratio!!!

e.g: 
	itemA has flexGrow 1 
	itemB has flexGrow 3
	the container size is 500px, each item takes 200px
	-
	the remaining space is 100px (500 - (200 * 2))
	each flex-grow unit is 25px (100 / (1 + 3))
	-
	itemA total size will be 225px (200 + (1 * 25))
	itemB total size will be 275px (200 + (3 * 25))
