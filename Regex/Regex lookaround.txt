Regex lookaround
----------------
(?!)  - negative lookahead
(?=)  - positive lookahead
(?<!) - negative lookbehind
(?<=) - positive lookbehind

--

sample:
robyaviavi
avi(?!avi) returns the 2nd avi (with no preliminary avi)

process:
input: aaanotbbbcccdddnoteee
pattern: ((aaa|bbb|ccc|ddd|eee)(?!not))

the 1st group will match the following: 
aaa
bbb
ccc
ddd
eee

then, each will look ahead to check if it followed by the word 'not' 
both aaa and ddd have 'not' after them so they'll be omitted from the matches

result
bbb
ccc
eee
