CSS Link - Inline Media Queries 
-------------------------------
we can load conditionally CSS files from within the HTML using the 'link' tag with the 'media' property.
this technique allows us to better organize our CSS layouts by loading only the relevant CSS per device. 
when using Inline Media Queries, the browser download the files but it only processes the one that matches the media filter 
(as opposed to the CSS media queries which all are being processed)

note!
we can also use nested media queries. 
for example, by adding the following media rule for smaller phones within the phone.css (which will only load for 480px and down)
@media (max-width: 200px){ 
	... 
}

[SAMPLE-1] desktop base with override layout per device 

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title></title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/desktop.css" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" media='screen and (max-width: 1024px)' href="css/laptop.css" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" media='screen and (max-width: 768px)' href="css/tablet.css" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" media='screen and (max-width: 480px)' href="css/phone.css" />
</head>
<body>
    <h1>
        What is Lorem Ipsum?
    </h1>
    <p>
        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.         
    </p>
    <p>
        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.        
    </p>
    <p>
        It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.        
    </p>
    <p>
        It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
