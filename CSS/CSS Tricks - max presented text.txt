max presented text
------------------
set 'overflow' to 'hidden' to disable the scrollers. 
set 'white-space' to 'nowrap' to use a single line mode.
set 'text-overflow' to 'ellipsis' in order to get the 3 dots (...) after the truncated content.
set the desired maximum width.

sample
------

h5 {
	overflow: hidden;
	white-space: nowrap;
	text-overflow: ellipsis;
	max-width: 100px;
}

<h5>
	Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
