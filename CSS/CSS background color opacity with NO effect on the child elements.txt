CSS background color opacity with NO effect on the child elements

using the following css rule will create a grey-kind background color with 50% opacity.

using opacity:
background-color: #b8b4b4;
opacity: 0.5;

there's only one problem here > the opacity auto applied to the child elements of the control using it!
to change this Behaviour, we need to use rgba instead. using rgba with opacity will affect ONLY the background color
and NOT any of the elements within the wrapper element.  

using rgba:
background-color: rgba(184,180,180,0.5);
