# Editor with Document user interface

CKEditor comes with a variety of editor types and user interface configuration options you can choose from. See all of them in action.

The Document editor provides a similar editing experience to some native word processors such as Microsoft Word, with the UI that resembles a paper document.

See this demo live at [ckeditor.com](http://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-5/demo/editor-types.html#document) or read more about it in the [CKEditor 5 documentation](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/examples/builds/document-editor.html).
