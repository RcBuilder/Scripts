Bug:
no access to 127.0.0.1

Issue:
after creating a website with host on the local IIS, 
we can reach it using 'localhost' but not using 127.0.0.1 ip.

(hosts)
127.0.0.1	proxy.crtv.co.il

> ping proxy.crtv.co.il
127.0.0.1

Cause:
need to add an ip-listener to 127.0.0.1

Solution:
(cmd)
> netsh http add iplisten 127.0.0.1
