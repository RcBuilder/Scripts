Bug:
Port xxx is already being used by another application.

Issue:
while trying to launch a website locally, an exception of port in-use is thrown.

Cause:
duplicate port number 

Config:
.vs folder > appName > config > applicationhost.config

Solution:
1. within the .vs folder, find the 'applicationhost.config' > edit
2. under 'sites' tag > find the site 
3. bindings > set port (http & https)
