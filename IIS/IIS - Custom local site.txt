Custom local site - IIS:
------------------------

* open hosts file (C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc)
* add new rule : 127.0.0.1 [someName]

  example: 
  127.0.0.1 ynet 

  the above rule means that once using the path http://ynet you'll reach the localhost. 
  each call to the localhost is processed via the IIS pipe  

* open IIS 
* Sites -> add web site 
* set siteName, app pool and the physical path to the files 
* bind http type on port 80 and set the host name to be 'ynet' 
  // http://ynet now points to the created site
