IIS Local SSL Certificate
-------------------------

(steps)
1. Open PowerShell 
2. Create a Self-Signed Certificate command:
   > New-SelfSignedCertificate -Subject "localhost" -TextExtension @("2.5.29.17={text}DNS=localhost&IPAddress=127.0.0.1&IPAddress=::1")

   note! 
   can add more IPAddresses or DNS hosts if needed (in this case localhost + 127.0.0.1 + ::1 were added)
