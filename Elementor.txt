Elementor is a popular WordPress page builder plugin that allows users to visually design and customize websites without coding knowledge. 
It works as an overlay to WordPress, providing a drag-and-drop interface where users can create and edit pages in real-time with a live preview. 
The Elementor designs are stored in the WordPress database and loaded when visitors access the site. 
When someone visits your WordPress site with Elementor, they're seeing the rendered result of what you built in the Elementor editor, not the editor itself.

There are several alternatives to build a WordPress website without using Elementor:
1. WordPress Block Editor (Gutenberg) - The native editor that comes built-in with WordPress, offering block-based content creation.
2. Other page builders like Beaver Builder, Divi, or Visual Composer - Similar drag-and-drop functionality as Elementor but with different features and interfaces.
3. WordPress themes - Many premium themes come with their own customization options and visual builders (like Avada, Astra, or OceanWP).
4. Custom coding - Using HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript to build custom WordPress themes from scratch or modify existing ones.
5. Classic WordPress Editor - The traditional TinyMCE editor for those who prefer the older WordPress interface.
6. Theme builders like GeneratePress or Kadence - Lightweight themes with powerful customization options.
