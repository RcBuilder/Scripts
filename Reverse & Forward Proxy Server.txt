Reverse Proxy Server
--------------------
an intermediate server that handles HTTP requests. 
it serves as a gateway between users and the application origin server.
it uses a facade layer as an endpoint, clone the original request, pass it on to the original 
application corresponding endpoint and return the response back to the end user.

handles http requests from the web and forward them to the origin application server.
this type of server sits between the end-user and the application server!

use cases:
- when have several servers and need a single server to route the requests. 
- to set application load balancing on application level
- to monitor http requests to the target application
- to add http logger for requests to the target application
- to add server-level logic to the http pipeline (for the target application) 
- to enforce reaching the application for a single endpoint (by allowing only the proxy ip)
- to set different routing rules of the target application

Forward Proxy Server
--------------------
an intermediate server that handles HTTP requests before reaching out to the WEB. 
usually used internally by large organizations. 
located in the organization's network edge so it also can block incoming & outbound traffic.

handles http requests BEFORE reaching the web and forward them to the origin website.
this type of server sits between the organization's LAN and the WEB!

use cases:
- to block employees from visiting certain websites (facebook etc.)
- to block malicious incoming traffic
- to monitor ANY outbound http to the WEB
- to monitor ANY incoming http from the WEB
- to cache external sites content internally
- to bypass firewall restrictions (by country, ip etc.)
