NET CODE CYCLE
--------------
1. Source Code is Compiled using the correspondind compiler. 
   (C# uses C# Compiler, VB.NET uses VB.NET Compiler etc.)
2. the Compiler compiles the code into CIL (aka MSIL)
3. the CLR uses JIT to transform the CIL to Machine Code

process:
Source-Code > (Compiler) > MSIL/ CIL Code + MetaData > JIT Compiler > Machine-Code
