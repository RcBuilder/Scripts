Responsive design: 
------------------
is when your website design can be adapted to the width and height of the device it is being viewed on.
its done by using media queries in your CSS file.

Viewport meta tag:
------------------
tells the browser how to behave when it renders the webpage.
it zoom in/out the site to match the Viewport defined width.

Example:
--------
// auto width with 100% scale and max scale of 100%
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1" />

---

// set a specific width
<meta name="viewport" content="width=320">

// auto width - match the device it is being viewed on
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">

---

// the user will not need to zoom in or out
<meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1">

// disable the user from scrolling 
<meta name="viewport" content="maximum-scale=1">
