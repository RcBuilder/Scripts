SQL RECOVERY MODELS
-------------------
a database configuration option to determines the backup type.
provides the ability to restore data if needed.

syntax:
ALTER DATABASE <dbName> SET RECOVERY <recoveryMode>

e.g:
ALTER DATABASE SomeDatabase SET RECOVERY SIMPLE

---

SELECT recovery_model_desc FROM sys.databases where name = '<dbName>'

---

managment studio:
1. right click on the db > properties
2. (tab) Options > Recovery model 
3. choose a model

---

SIMPLE:
partial backup.
No Support for Transaction log. it re-uses the log space every time a CHECKPOINT opeation occurs.
commonly used in databases which contain non-important content (Test databases etc.)
reduces the log file.

FULL:
full backup.
all transactions are fully logs and recorded.
fit for databases which contain important data which we can afford to lose in any case.
might generates a massive log file (in cases of a massive table deletion etc.)

BULK_LOGGED:
something in between SIMPLE and FULL model. 
supports more restoration features than SIMPLE model but NOT all of them. 
waives some log-writes and by that, reduces the log file size.
