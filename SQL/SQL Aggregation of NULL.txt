SQL Aggregation of NULL
-----------------------
SQL engine omits all NULL values before aggregating the data. 
once all NULLs were removed, it aggregates the result. 
because this process is implicit, SQL also includes the following warning message along with the result
"Warning: Null value is eliminated by an aggregate or other SET operation."

---

(Not Recommended)
to remove the warning message use this statement:
SET ANSI_WARNINGS <OFF|ON>;

CREATE TABLE #t1(Name CHAR(1), Value INT)
INSERT INTO #t1 
VALUES ('A', 10), ('B', 20), ('C', 30), ('D', NULL), ('E', NULL)

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM #t1		-- 5
SELECT COUNT(Name) FROM #t1		-- 5
SELECT COUNT(Value) FROM #t1		-- 3    (D and E were removed!)

SELECT SUM(Value) FROM #t1		-- 60   (D and E were removed!)
SELECT AVG(Value) FROM #t1		-- 20   (D and E were removed!)
