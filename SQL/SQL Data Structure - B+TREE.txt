SQL Data Structure - B+TREE
---------------------------
SQL uses B+TREE data structure to store the data.
(see 'B-Tree vs B+Tree vs Binary Tree')

-

Non-Leaf vs Leaf Nodes:
a leaf node includes the actual data whereas, a non-leaf node includes a refernce to another node (leaf or non-leaf). 

in B+Tree, all data should be in the same level (which gives us the abillity to loop through all of the actual data) 
so the last level nodes in a tree are those containing the actual data. 

(see 'non-Leaf and leaf tree nodes.gif')
