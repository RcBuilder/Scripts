SQL Identity Jumping 1000 Issue
-------------------------------
Identity Jumping 1000 â€“ IDENTITY_CACHE.

a known old issue where suddenly an identity column value has auto-incremented by 1000! 
this usually happens if SQL Server is not shutdown properly (unexpected shutdown). 
when identity cache is OFF, SQL Server takes a very little performance hit.

(steps) how to solve this issue?
1. disable IDENTITY_CACHE flag:
   ALTER DATABASE SCOPED CONFIGURATION SET IDENTITY_CACHE = OFF
2. set the identity-seed value to a new value
   DBCC CHECKIDENT ('<table_name>', RESEED, <new_seed>)

cause:
to improve the performance of the INSERT statements, SQL engine allocates and caches the next 1000 identity values for the table. 
in cases of an unexpected crash scenario, it loses those pre-generated identity values and that behavior causes the 1000 value jump!

ALTER DATABASE SCOPED CONFIGURATION SET IDENTITY_CACHE = OFF

CREATE TABLE TEMP(Id INT IDENTITY(1,1), [Name] NCHAR(1))
INSERT INTO TEMP VALUES('A'), ('B')
INSERT INTO TEMP VALUES('C'), ('D')
SELECT * FROM TEMP
DBCC CHECKIDENT ('TEMP', RESEED, 6)
INSERT INTO TEMP VALUES('E'), ('F')

output:
Id	Name
1	A
2	B
3	C
4	D
7	E
8	F
