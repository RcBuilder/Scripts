SQL DELETE Best Practice
------------------------
as a thumb-rule, when deleting a large table we should use TRUNCATE (if possible)
or use the SIMPLE Recovery model along with a loop to delete the table using small chunks. 

reference: 
'SQL DELETE & LOG'

delete by chunks:
// step-1 -> temporary use SIMPLE Recovery model to signal the SQL we don't need log
ALTER DATABASE TEST SET RECOVERY SIMPLE

// step-2 -> delete table in small chunks using a loop (of any kind), use CHECKPOINT after each chunk 
DECLARE @Rows INT = 1;
WHILE (@Rows > 0)
BEGIN
   DELETE TOP (10000) FROM Guids; 
   SET @Rows = @@ROWCOUNT;
   CHECKPOINT;
END

// step-3 -> switch back to FULL Recovery model
ALTER DATABASE TEST SET RECOVERY FULL
