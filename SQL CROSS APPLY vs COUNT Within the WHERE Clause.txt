SQL CROSS APPLY vs COUNT Within the WHERE Clause
------------------------------------------------
important! 
the result's performance depends on lots of factors so any case should be checked individually in order to find the best approach. 
use the client-statistics feature to find out which approach is better!

--------

test:
using select within the where clause

query:
select	Medium, URL 
from	Artworks 
where (select count(value) from STRING_SPLIT(Medium, ' ')) = 1

result:
1st execution = 20 ms
2nd execution = 7 ms

---

test:
using cross-apply

query:
select	Medium, URL, t.cnt 
from	Artworks A CROSS APPLY (select count(value) as cnt from STRING_SPLIT(A.Medium, ' ')) t
where	t.cnt = 1

result:
1st execution = 16 ms
2nd execution = 6 ms
