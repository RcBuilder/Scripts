ReadOnlySpan 
------------
ReadOnlySpan is a struct so it always lives in the STACK instead of the HEAP 
and therefore, evaporates once reaching the end of the code block. 
hence, it doesn't trigger the GC which is an expensive process.  

sample:
ReadOnlySpan<char> spnDate = "2021-07-14"; 
var year = int.Parse(spnDate.Slice(0, 4));

tip:
use Benchmark.NET to watch the Memory and Execution-Time (see 'Benchmark.NET')
