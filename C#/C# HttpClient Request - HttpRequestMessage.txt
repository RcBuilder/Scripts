C# HttpClient Request - HttpRequestMessage
------------------------------------------
we have the ability to work with a single client on a request-level basis. 
commonly used when working with a single (static) client (best practices). 
instead of adding headers and configuration on the client level, we can create a request object and send them as per call!

steps:
1. create a HttpRequestMessage object
2. set required preperties
3. use the SendAsync method

syntax:
static HttpClient client = new HttpClient();

async Task Fun(){
	var request = new HttpRequestMessage() { ... };
	...
	...
	using (var resonse = await client.SendAsync(request)){ ... }
}
