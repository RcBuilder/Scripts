DirectoryInfo Bug - Relative Path
---------------------------------
for cases where the current executor (linqpad, windows service, etc.) is located 
in the same drive as the loaded path - we MUST use '\' as suffix of the populated value.

e.g:
// when the executor is located under drive C, it's relative path will be loaded as folder 
var folder = new DirectoryInfo("C:"); 

// to fix that behaviour, we need to add '\' suffix 
var folder = new DirectoryInfo("C:\"); 

--

Console.WriteLine(new DirectoryInfo("C:").FullName);   // C:\ProgramData\LINQPad\Updates50\543
Console.WriteLine(new DirectoryInfo("C:\\").FullName); // C:\
