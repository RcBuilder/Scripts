What is SaaS?
-------------
Saas stands-for Software As A Service. 

Any software that we sell as a service (based on a monthly fee etc.) instead of selling it as a final package 
serves as Saas.

an application which needs to be downloaded to installed as package to our machine 
called Saap (SaaP - Software As A Product).

for example, we can create a CRM product which a user can buy as a final product and installed it as a package 
and, alternatively, we can create an Online CRM which is hosted in our servers and one can pay to use this service. 
the payment can be monthly, pay-as-you-go or any other option we define. 

when using SaaS, the user don't have to handle/worry about IT infrastructure, Servers, Updates etc...
it's all under the service provider responsibility.

the provider provides not a simple product to be installed but a resource to be consumed!
