=======================

PreInit:
--------
1. Check the 'IsPostBack' property
2. Create or re-create dynamic controls
3. Set a master page dynamically
4. Set the 'Theme' property dynamically

note! 
If the request is a postback, the values of the controls have not yet been restored from view state. 
If you set a control property at this stage, its value might be overwritten in the next event.

Init:
-----
Raised after all controls have been initialized and any skin settings have been applied. 
Use this event to read or initialize control properties.


InitComplete:
-------------
Raised by the Page object. Use this event for processing tasks that require all initialization be complete.


PreLoad:
--------
Use this event if you need to perform processing on your page or control before the Load event.
in this stage the view state and postback data are already loaded.


Load:
-----
The Page calls the OnLoad event method on the Page, then recursively does the same for each child control, 
which does the same for each of its child controls until the page and all controls are loaded.
Use the OnLoad event method to set properties in controls and establish database connections.

Control events:
---------------
Use these events to handle specific control events, such as a Button control's Click event or a TextBox control's TextChanged event.


LoadComplete:
-------------
Use this event for tasks that requires all other controls on the page to be loaded.


PreRender:
----------
The PreRender event occurs for each control on the page. 
Use the event to make final changes to the contents of the page or its controls.


PreRenderComplete:
------------------
occurs after the page and all the controls PreRender event were completed


SaveViewState:
--------------
save the ViewState for the page and for all the controls. 


SaveStateComplete:
------------------
Before this event occurs, ViewState has been saved for the page and for all the controls. 
Any changes to the page or controls at this point will be ignored.
Use this event to perform tasks that requires view state to be saved, but that do not make any changes to controls.


Render:
-------
This is not an event; instead, at this stage of processing, the Page object calls this method on each control. 
All ASP.NET Web server controls have a Render method that writes out the control's markup that is sent to the browser.
If you create a custom control, you typically override this method to output the control's markup.


Unload:
-------
This event occurs for each control and then for the page. 
In controls, use this event to do final cleanup for specific controls, such as closing control-specific database connections.
For the page itself, use this event to do final cleanup work, such as closing open files and database connections, 
or finishing up logging or other request-specific tasks.

note:	
During the unload stage, the page and its controls are being rendered, 
so you cannot make further changes to the response stream. 
If you'll attempt to call a method such as the Response.Write method, the page will throw an exception.
