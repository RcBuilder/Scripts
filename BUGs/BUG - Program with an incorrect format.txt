Bug:
calling functions from a 32-bit unmanaged DLL on a 64-bit system

Error:
"An attempt was made to load a program with an incorrect format"

Cause:
when trying to run 32bit apps on 64bit machine using IIS.

Solution:
1. load the 32bit project 
2. change its Platform Target to be 'x64' or 'Any CPU' 
3. build

Notes:
might also occurs as a dependency when one app uses a referenced 32bit dll.
