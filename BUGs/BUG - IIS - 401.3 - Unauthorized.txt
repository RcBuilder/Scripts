Bug:
IIS - 401.3 - Unauthorized

Error:
You do not have permission to view this directory or page because of the access control list (ACL) configuration or encryption settings for this resource on the Web server

Cause:
from some unknown reason (myybe cache of some sort), the program thinks that it still refer to the previous version of the dll 

Solution:
Open IIS > Choose a website > Authentication > Anonymous authentication > Edit
Set User as 'Identity of the application pool'
