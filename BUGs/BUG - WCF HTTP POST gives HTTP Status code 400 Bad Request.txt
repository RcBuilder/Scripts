Bug:
WCF HTTP POST gives HTTP Status code 400 : Bad Request (fiddler)

Error:
when using fiddler to perform a POST request to a WCF service with body (json)
we got an 400 bad request response 

note!
works with no body  

Solution:
add Content-Type http header and set it as application/json
 
e.g:

POST http://localhost/myService  // OK (no-body)

POST http://localhost/myService // ERROR
body: { "Id": "1234"}

POST http://localhost/myService // OK
Content-Type: application/json
body: { "Id": "1234"}
