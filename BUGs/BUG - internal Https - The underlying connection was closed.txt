Bug:
internal https communication between servers returns an "underlying connection was closed..." message

Error:
The underlying connection was closed: Could not establish trust relationship for the SSL/TLS secure channel

Cause:
Tls support issue

Solution:
set the 'SecurityProtocol' and the 'ServerCertificateValidationCallback' properties of the global 'ServicePointManager' object

e.g:
// trust all certificates
ServicePointManager.SecurityProtocol = SecurityProtocolType.Tls11 | SecurityProtocolType.Tls12 | SecurityProtocolType.Ssl3;
ServicePointManager.ServerCertificateValidationCallback = ((sender, certificate, chain, sslPolicyErrors) => true);
