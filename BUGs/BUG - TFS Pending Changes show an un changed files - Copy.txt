Bug:
Visual Studio TFS shows unchanged files in the list of pending changes

Issue:
the TEAM EXPLORER pending changes window shows files with no actual change
can be caused by a change that canceled and returns to its original state

Solution:
1. in VS (2012 and up)
2. FILE -> Source Control -> Advanced -> Workplaces
3. Edit the workplace 
4. Advanced -> set Location to be Local (instead of server)

this will create a local copy of the original file and It will then automatically hide 
unchanged files from pending changes.
