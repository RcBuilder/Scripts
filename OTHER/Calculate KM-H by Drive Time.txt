Calculate KM/H by Drive Time
----------------------------

Formula:
(Distance In KM / Time In Minutes) * 60 = speed (KM/H)

---

samples:
john drove 90 minutes to reach a distance of 60 KM
60/90 * 60 = 40
speed 40 KM/H
-
john drove 90 minutes to reach a distance of 120 KM
120/90 * 60 = 80
speed 80 KM/H
-
bolt run 10 seconds to reach a 100 meters distance
(100/1000) / (10/60)	// convert to KM and Min
0.1/0.166 * 60 = 36
speed 36 KM/H
