Segments      
--------
use segments to create an internal list of members (within the main list) by a condition (such as group).
for example, all members within the current list who belongs to the group 'Students'.
later we can define a campaign of that list and segment, so it'll apply ONLY for the 'Students' group and NOT for all members.

-

static segment: 
we can also create a 'static segment' which is a segment with a static list of emails and not a conditioned-like group 

-      

Campaigns are used for sending a designed email to a group of members (using lists and segments) 
we can create a campaign on a specific segment and list, design it and send it using the api afterwards. 
      
how to send an email for a specific members using the api? (steps)
1. create a list of members (e.g: STUDENTS), 
2. create a group for each class (e.g: CLASS-A, CLASS-B)
3. create a segment and choose the groups to include within it(e.g: CLASS-A-SEGMENT) 
4. create a campaign on that list and segment (CLASS-A-CAMPAIGN)
5. use the api to send the campaign 
   endpoint: /campaigns/{campaign_id}/actions/send
