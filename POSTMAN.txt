POSTMAN 
=======

Collections
-----------
create a collection of requests.

1. go to 'Collections' tab (from the left pane)
2. press on 'Create' 
3. add requests as per need 


capabilities:
* export and import postman collections
* share a collection 
* run a collection (execute all requests one after the other)
* duplicate a collection
* create a Monitor on a collection 
* create a Mock server from a collection 


Environments
------------
add variables to inject to postman requests

1. go to 'Environments' tab (from the left pane)
2. press on 'Create' > add variables with default values

to use the variables: 
1. choose the Environments collection to use from the dropdown located at the top-right. 
2. use the double curly brackets({{}}) to inject a variable by its name 
   for example: {{VAR1}} 
   e.g: http://example.com?a={{VAR1}}&b={{VAR2}}

tip:
set collection per environment (PROD, LOCAL, QA) and include within it the relevant variables (base-url, headers etc.)
that way we could use a single collection for multiple environments! 

e.g: 
envPROD -> url=http://domain.com 
envQA -> url=http://staging.domain.com
envLOCAL -> url=http://127.0.0.1

note! 
once collection was choosen, we can inject the variable anywhere! 
(header, url, body etc.)

1. go to 'Monitors' tab (from the left pane)

------------
create a mock api server with custom rules

1. go to 'Mock Servers' tab (from the left pane)

   e.g: https://815b5353-db88-4530-857f-91a10eaaac8f.mock.pstmn.io
5. test your server by executing the endpoints using your favorite provider (postman, browser, fiddler etc.)
