thanks, Roby (-:

--------------------------------------

configuration:
just add your mail at the top of the script 

working process (just for you to know):
the script creates a file in the google drive of the adwords account which it runs in.(you can change the file name)
it then collects all the active campaigns and each conversions quantity and add it to the file.
each execution it compares the new against the old conversions quantity and update the file for the next execution.

at the top of the script you will find 3 variables which you can control on:
var FPB_LABEL = 'FirstPageBidRule';
var TPB_LABEL = 'TopPageBidRule';

--------------------------------------

scripts capabilities: 

- there's no problem of creating  adgroups, ads etc. based on some sheet file or even an outer feed (site xml, json etc.)
- we can also use the adwords BULK operations which allows you to upload full campaigns in an async manner 

- we can update ads content based on a website input using crawlers or based on any other requested logic 
- we can generate script which manage the position by pre-defined settings:
// e.g:
'Primary' : { bid: 0.1, position: 3, tolerance: 0.1 } // destination: position 3, increase value: 0.1 with tolerance of 0.1
'Secondary' : { bid: 0.2, position: 3, tolerance: 0.1 }
'Experiment' : { bid: 0.3, position: 3, tolerance: 0.1 } 

- we can set keywords position to always be at the 1st page
- can promote or demote keywords position and price by performance (conversions etc.)
- can set non-converting keywords as negative 
- send notification on each new conversion 
- send daily report on non converting keywords 
- monitor the landing pages (check each status - if it down - pause ad or notify via e-mail) 
- account (etc.) daily or monthly stats with charts 
- working on topics, placements and audiences
- convert converted search queries into actual keywords 
- create BLACK LIST placements by any logic (domain suffix etc. - all the .ru domains for example or all domains contains the word forex ....)
- increase cost per converted
- we can generate a forecast script for budget - to check if we are going to exceed the budget etc.
- low quality score keywords daily report 
- top 10 daily reports - spending, converting etc.
- creating ads based on search queries 
- campaign statistics by requested period (weekly, monthly etc.) or period vs period (7 days vs 30 days stats etc.)


- in addition, we can connect to any analytics account and combined data from there .. a bit more complicated and requires an OAUTH but doable  

hope you'll find those suggestions effective, there's a lot of more options of course

--------------------------------------
(R) Allways On Top [attached]

at the top of the script you'll find the following variables (set them for your needs)
1. FBBID // first page bid increment
2. TPBID // top page bid increment
3. MAXBID // includes 3 level labels (each one with the max bid allowed) 

this script basically try to set the bids automatically by increase or decrease them each execution
it looks at the bid prices and adopt your bids accordingly (2 ways - it might be a scenario where your bid is too high and you can p-ay less for the same spot)

the MAXBID variable allows you to set max bid limitation for 3 labels (so you can set priorities  such as primary, secondary etc.)

the FBBID and TPBID are the "Jumps" to make to your bid on each execution (if needed of course)

--------------------------------------
(R) Search Queries to Negative Keywords - custom search (Set) [attached]

at the top of the script you'll find the following variables (set them for your needs)
1. CLICKS, CONVERSIONS, IMPRESSIONS, CTR // metrics filter
2. DATE_RANGE // period filter 

the script make a query to fetch all the data match the metrics filter you supplied in the date range you provided
e.g: CLICKS = 100 ... DATE_RANGE = LAST_30_DAYS 

--------------------------------------
copy script to your account: 
1. open the script with any editor (notepad etc.) 
2. copy 
3. go to your MCC account -> bulk operations (left pane) -> scripts 
4. create new (+ button) 
5. paste 
6. save 

schedule your script: 
once a script established - you control its schedule via the scripts panel 
you can also perform an immediate execution 
--------------------------------------

[Generic Ads Creator]

more about the script: 

this script uses a google sheet as its data supplier and generates adwords ads based on it. 
it supports multiple sheets whereas each sheet represents an ad. 
(attached a sample of the sheet structure) 

it uses labels on campaign level to determine where to add the generated ads. 
each ad includes an adgroup, keywords and ad.

variables: 
at the top of the script you'll find a few variables to set

var DATA_SPREADSHEET = 'AdsCreatorSheet'; // the sheet name
var LABEL_NAME = 'AdsRule'; // only campaign/s labeled with this label will generate this ad
var adGroupDefaultBid = 0.1; // the default bid for the keywords

Q:can I have some more details on your service?

of course 
i write great automation scripts for adwords. the scripts can do almost ANY action  you can do manually. 
the scripts have access to lots of 3rd party services (by google and others) and we can use it to generate reports, maintain an adwords account, send mails, read feeds and do some logic based on them and more and more ... 

an example for a script can be a monitor script which checks for broken ad final url and notifies the account owner before it uses all its budget. 
another good example can be adding a NON PROFIT searches to a negative Keywords,
and there's lots more ...  

let me know if you need any further assistance

hi 
I'm not an SEM guy but a developer who creates great automation scripts (which saves you time and therefore, m-oney). 

you need to dictate to me the process you're doing manually and i will code it into a script which does it automatically for you and based on a schedule time you determine.  

for example: if you find yourself waste too much time on checking broken ads or removing non-converting keywords or any other AdWords-related action - just provide me the steps you do manually and I'll convert it to a running script and you'll never have to waste more time on this process ... 

thanks, Roby (-:

----------------


basically it's a code snippet that can do almost every manual work you do on your AdWords account. 
we can then schedule the script to run hourly, daily, etc. 
the script capabilities are vast and include actions that you can do on your account, interacting with 3rd parties services, integrating with google sheets, docs, save and read files from your google drive, send mails, generate reports and much more ... 
you have NO limitation on the number of scripts to use so you can add as many as you want and for any purpose.

hi buddy, hope you are well

here's a short video explaining how it works and how to implement scripts:
https://www.fiverr.com/adwordsscripts/write-a-script-to-track-your-adwords-account

to recap,
adwords scripts are automation scripts to ease the maintenance of your account by doing most of the manual-recurring actions automatically so you gets a better and more accurate results and in addition, saving lots of manpower.
almost anything you can do manually - I can convert to an automatic process.
we can send mails, reports, set bids, create ads, work with drive spreadsheets, call to external services, create negative entities, excluded placements, dynamic adgroups and more and more...

few examples for simple but very-effective scripts are:
- set non-converting queries as negative keywords
- pause ads with broken final-url
- converting converting search-terms into actual keywords
- get daily report to your mail
...
...

hope it helps

hi there... 
i assume when you refer to the tracking script, you mean the conversion script that has been implemented within your website ... 

you should just plant it there (before the closing of the BODY tag within the HTML), nothing more...
 
regarding my services, I provide an automation script of ANY kind for ANY logic to your google ads.
basically, it's like smalls bots which each provides a specific process on your account entities (campaign, adgroup, ads, keywords, etc.)

we can use those bots for almost ANY action you do manually like checking ad URLs, creating a positive/negative KWs, creating ads automatically based on a data source (like a data feed) or custom logic, and lots more 

just find a process that is time-consuming for you and I'll convert it into a script that executes based on your schedule (minimum interval is 60 min) 

I have several prepared scripts for special prices and I can create any script from scratch for you!
you'll only be charged for the dev time we invest in creating it.
