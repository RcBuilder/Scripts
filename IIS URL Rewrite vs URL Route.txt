IIS URL Rewrite vs URL Route
----------------------------

URL Rewriting:
- modifying the requested URL before the Web server decides which handler to use to process the request.
- no changes to the orignal typed url. 
- the rewrite module is a native code module that plugs into the request-pipeline. 
- the rewrite module lives at the very early stage of the request-pipeline > the 'Begin Request' stage!
- it uses pre-defined rewrite rules.
- applied to ALL requests.
- can be used with ANY web application.
- has access to all the request-data (HTTP headers, server variables etc.)
- can perform redirection, abort requests and issue a custom status codes. 

URL Route: 
- request-dispatching mechanism that lets developers associate a certain URL with the processing handler.
- no url changes! it only reacts to the orignal typed url by finding the appropriate handler to process the request. 
- the routing module is a managed-code module that plugs into the IIS request-pipeline.
- the routing module lives at the middle stage of the request-pipeline > the 'Execute Handler' stage!
- it uses pre-defined registered routes that define which handler to invoke for a particular URL path.
- applied to ALL requests.
- limited to .NET web applications!
- has limited access to ONLY the URL path and HTTP-Method header!

recap:
the rewrite module manipulate URL paths before the request is handled by the Web server.
the routing module maps a processing handler based on the provided URL path (handler-mapping mechanism).
