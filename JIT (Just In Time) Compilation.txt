JIT (Just In Time) Compiler
---------------------------
the engine converts managed code into a machine code at run-time.
executed by the CLR.

process:
Source-Code > (Compiler) > MSIL/ CIL Code + MetaData > JIT Compiler > Machine-Code

compilation types:
- Normal JIT Compilation
  code is compiled at run-time when called and the compiled code is stored in memory cache, 
  other requests to the same code will be fetched directly from memory. 
  the cached compiled-code commonly referred as 'jitted'.

- Econo JIT Compilation
  no cache layer, every call complies the CIL code at run-time and return the complied code.

- Pre-JIT Compilation
  pre-compile ALL CIL code and store it in memory cache before startup. 
  no run-time compilation.
