$watch:
use it to explicitly watch a model. we can add our own custom logic on each change of the model value. 
any change occurs on the watched model will trigger the registered callback function.

$scope.$watch(<model>, <callback>);

note:
behind the scenes angular engine auto-sets a watcher for each view expression (e.g: {{ someModel }}).

reference:
$digest

sample:
$scope.$watch('someModel', function(newValue, oldValue) {
  // update the DOM
});
