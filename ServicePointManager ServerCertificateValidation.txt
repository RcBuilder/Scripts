ServicePointManager ServerCertificateValidation
-----------------------------------------------
use this global event to define for which certificates to trust when making requests from the server.

we need this patch when there's something wrong with the installed certificates (self-signed certificate, mismatch hostname and etc.)
This is dangerous for requests to servers outside of our control. 
commonly used for internal requests between servers (127.0.0.1 etc.)

1. trust all certificates
   ServicePointManager.ServerCertificateValidationCallback = ((sender, certificate, chain, sslPolicyErrors) => true);

2. trust specific certificates
   ServicePointManager.ServerCertificateValidationCallback = ((sender, certificate, chain, sslPolicyErrors) => certificate.Subject.Contains("YourServerName"));

3. use method to define the trusted certificates
   ServicePointManager.ServerCertificateValidationCallback += new RemoteCertificateValidationCallback(ValidateRemoteCertificate);
   private static bool ValidateRemoteCertificate(object sender, X509Certificate certificate, X509Chain chain, SslPolicyErrors sslPolicyErrors) {
       return certificate.Subject.Contains("YourServerName");
   }

sample:
ServicePointManager.SecurityProtocol = SecurityProtocolType.Tls11 | SecurityProtocolType.Tls12 | SecurityProtocolType.Ssl3;
ServicePointManager.ServerCertificateValidationCallback = ((sender, certificate, chain, sslPolicyErrors) => true);
