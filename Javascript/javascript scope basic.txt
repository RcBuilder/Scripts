javascript scope basic
----------------------
types:
1. Block scope
2. Function scope
3. Global scope

local scope:
use 'Block' scope
use this technique when working with several files using the same variable names (web-workers and etc.)
see sample at 'javascript web-workers'

-

[Block]
use curly brackets

{
  let x = 1;
}
// x can NOT be accessed here

-

[Function]
every function has its own scope

function fun1() {
  let x = 2;
}
// x can NOT be accessed here

-

[Global]
any variable declared outside a function

let x = 3;
function fun1() {
   console.log(x); // ok
}
console.log(x); // ok
