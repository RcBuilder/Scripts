const keyword:
once a variable is assigned it cannot be assigned again and any attempt to do so will throw an error!

exception:
Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable

syntax:
const [variable] = [value]; 

sample:
const p = 10;
p = 11; // exception

const a = { x:1, y:2 };
a.x = 3; // ok 
a = { x:3, y:4 }; // exception    

note:
we can still change the inner object properties but an attempt to re-assign a new object on a const variable 
will ends-up in an exception (see the above sample)
