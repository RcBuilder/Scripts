what is proxy maneger:
aka super Proxy.
a proxy of a proxy. 
a single proxy which manages the the outboand traffic. 
it uses the api to connect to the proxy list, zone etc. and switch between them so we'll not be detected.
it also contains a network profiler so we can see the traffic being sent through it!

install the proxy manager:
download the setup file 'luminati-proxy-manager-v1.128.768-setup' and install it.

use the proxy manager:
after installation, click on the 'luminati proxy manager' icon.. 
a new listener (console app) will be created (usually on port 22999)..  
to reach the manager UI, go to the 127.0.0.1 with the genetated port (usually 24000)  
note that port 22999 is for the manager UI whereas port 24000 is the one needed to use as our proxy.

code sample:
while the proxy manager is running... 

using(var client = new WebClient()){
	client.Proxy = new WebProxy("127.0.0.1:24000");
 	client.DownloadString("http://lumtest.com/myip.json");
}
