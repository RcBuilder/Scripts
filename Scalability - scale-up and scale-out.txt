Scale-up
--------
aka Vertical Scaling.

one big strong server. 
refers to adding more processors and RAM, buying a more expensive and robust server.

Scale-out
---------
aka Horizontal Scaling.

multiple small servers working together.
refers to adding more servers with less processors and RAM.
This is usually cheaper overall and can literally scale infinitely.

Scale-up vs Scale-out
---------------------

Scale-up pros:
- less challenging to implement.
- less licensing costs.
- less Cooling costs.

Scale-out pros:
- much cheaper.
- unlimited scaling!
- if one server fails, others keep running.
