setting a reference to null DOES NOT change the object itself. it onlt set the pointer to points to nowhere.
the object still exists and will be wiped-off by the GC if no-one points to it.

example: 

object a = 1;
object b = a;
a = null;
Console.WriteLine(b);  // 1

explanation:
the object 1 (located in the HEAP) has two pointers (in the STACK) - 'a' and 'b'
we set 'a' to be null and points to nowhere but b still points to 1

-----

example: 

void SetString(string pStr) {
    pStr =  null;
}

var str = "String1";
SetString(str);
Console.WriteLine(str); // String1

explanation:
same here, two pointers 'str' and 'pStr' which points to the same "String1" object 
we've erased 'pStr' but 'str' still active.
