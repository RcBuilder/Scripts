Bug:
error 'read ECONNRESET' on postman

Error:
read ECONNRESET

Cause:
one of the servers (target or proxy) has closed the connection
most chances is that due to slow communication, the proxy has received header bytes but not the content itself
and then it closed the connection. 
this can only happens for HttpCompletionOption.ResponseHeadersRead!

Solution:
change proxy HttpCompletion to ResponseContentRead. 
HttpCompletionOption.ResponseContentRead! 
this option tells the proxy server to wait for the Body bytes instead of the Header bytes before closing the connection.

e.g:
private async Task<HttpResponseMessage> ForwardRequest(HttpRequestMessage request, CancellationToken cancellationToken) {        
    using (var client = new HttpClient()) {                
        client.Timeout = this.Timeout; 
        var clonedRequest = await CloneHttpRequestMessageAsync(request);
        clonedRequest.RequestUri = this.BuildTargetRequestUri(request);
        return await client.SendAsync(clonedRequest, HttpCompletionOption.ResponseContentRead, cancellationToken);
    }                        
}
