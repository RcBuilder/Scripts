SSO process:
an SSO request is created for each provider you want to add. 
once you create the SSO request and give the required permissions, supermetrics saves the returned token 
and attached it to your supermetrics-account.

how to use?
- go to the query builder (menu-tab)
- (tab) data source > confirm permissions window on the SSO 
  note: repeat this step for each source you want to add
- (tab) select views/ accounts 
- (tab) select date range
- complete your query using the rest of the listed tabs (split by, segment, filter, metrics, options etc.)
  note: the listed tabs vary based on the selected data source 

- a completed GET request will be generated based on the properties provided above, 
  copy it and use it in your app.

  tip:
  note that the api key exists as part as the query, you can create a shortened URL 
  to genetate an unique code which represents the query without exposing the key. it is also a URL-friendly.

api response format:
to specify the returned format, add the query parameter targetAppFormat and set the desired format. (e.g: &targetAppFormat=tableau)
formats > Supermatrics (json), tableau, qlik (csv), powerbi. (default: Supermatrics)
