Managed vs Unmanaged code
-------------------------

Managed code:
a code managed by the CLR (Common Language Runtime). 
the CLR also contains the GC component (Garbage Collector) which managing the memory automatically.
the CLR uses JIT to convert the managed code into a machine code at run-time.
ANY code written in .NET is managed-code.

compile to CIL (Common Intermediate Language), aka MSIL(Microsoft Intermediate Language), and execute under the management of the CLR. 
C#, F#, VB etc.

---

Unmanaged code:
a code that is not under .NET that compiles to direct machine code.
Memory MUST be handled by the developer.

compile directly to machine code and executed by OS. 
C++, Win32 etc.
