A, CNAME, ALIAS, and URL records are all possible solutions to point a host name to your site. 
A and CNAME records are standard DNS records.
ALIAS and URL records are custom DNS records.

CNAME Record
------------
Canonical Name record.
is a record that points to another domain address rather than an IP address. 
should only be used when there are no other records on that name! (unique record)

for example, say you have an old domain, like www.myOldDomain.com and you want it to 
point to your new domain name mydomain.com.

ALIAS Record
------------
the same as CNAME for non-unique records

A Record
--------
Address Record.
These records point your domain to the IP address of your website or hosting. 

URL Record
----------
redirects the name to the target name using the HTTP 301 status code.

A vs CNAME
----------
A record points to an IP whereas CNAME posints to a different name

e.g:
blog.dnsimple.com      A        185.31.17.133
blog.dnsimple.com      CNAME    aetrion.github.io

Which One To Use?
-----------------
A - to assign the domain to a specific machine by it's IP address.
CNAME - to assign a new domain instead of the other (and you don't need the other)
ALIAS - to assign other domains to point the same destination
URL - to redirect (change address) instead of resolving to a destination
