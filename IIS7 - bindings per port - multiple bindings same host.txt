* open IIS7 -> Sites -> Add Site
* set site name, app pool and physical path  
* set the host name and the associated port 
  we can add multiple bindings for the same host in a different port

----

example : 
we take the host 'www.myDomian.com' and create 3 different sites
each to different folder on the disk 
we bind each site to a different port 

site1 - host 'www.myDomian.com' on port 80
site2 - host 'www.myDomian.com' on port 5555
site3 - host 'www.myDomian.com' on port 7777

use 'www.myDomian.com' to reach site1
use 'www.myDomian.com:5555' to reach site2
use 'www.myDomian.com:7777' to reach site3
