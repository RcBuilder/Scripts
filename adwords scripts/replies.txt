configuration:
just add your mail at the top of the script 

working process (just for you to know):
the script creates a file in the google drive of the adwords account which it runs in.(you can change the file name)
it then collects all the active campaigns and each conversions quantity and add it to the file.
each execution it compares the new against the old conversions quantity and update the file for the next execution.

--------------------------------------

scripts capabilities: 

- there's no problem of creating  adgroups, ads etc. based on some sheet file or even an outer feed (site xml, json etc.)
- we can also use the adwords BULK operations which allows you to upload full campaigns in an async manner 

- we can update ads content based on a website input using crawlers or based on any other requested logic 
- we can generate script which manage the position by pre-defined settings:
// e.g:
'Primary' : { bid: 0.1, position: 3, tolerance: 0.1 } // destination: position 3, increase value: 0.1 with tolerance of 0.1
'Secondary' : { bid: 0.2, position: 3, tolerance: 0.1 }
'Experiment' : { bid: 0.3, position: 3, tolerance: 0.1 } 

- we can set keywords position to always be at the 1st page
- can promote or demote keywords position and price by performance (conversions etc.)
- can set non-converting keywords as negative 
- send notification on each new conversion 
- send daily report on non converting keywords 
- monitor the landing pages (check each status - if it down - pause ad or notify via email) 
- account (etc.) daily or monthly stats with charts 
- working on topics, placements and audiences
- convert converted search queries into actual keywords 
- create BLACK LIST placements by any logic (domain suffix etc. - all the .ru domains for example or all domains contains the word forex ....)
- increase cost per converted
- we can generate a forecast script for budget - to check if we are going to exceed the budget etc.
- low quality score keywords daily report 
- top 10 daily reports - spending, converting etc.
- creating ads based on search queries 
- campaign statistics by requested period (weekly, monthly etc.) or period vs period (7 days vs 30 days stats etc.)


- in addition, we can connect to any analytics account and combined data from there .. a bit more complicated and requires an OAUTH but doable  

hope you'll find those suggestions effective, there's a lot of more options of course

(R) Allways On Top [attached]

at the top of the script you'll find the following variables (set them for your needs)
1. FBBID // first page bid increment
2. TPBID // top page bid increment
3. MAXBID // includes 3 level labels (each one with the max bid allowed) 

this script basically try to set the bids automatically by increase or decrease them each execution
it looks at the bid prices and adopt your bids accordingly (2 ways - it might be a scenario where your bid is too high and you can p-ay less for the same spot)

the MAXBID variable allows you to set max bid limitation for 3 labels (so you can set priorities  such as primary, secondary etc.)

the FBBID and TPBID are the "Jumps" to make to your bid on each execution (if needed of course)

--------------------------------------
(R) Search Queries to Negative Keywords - custom search (Set) [attached]

at the top of the script you'll find the following variables (set them for your needs)

the script make a query to fetch all the data match the metrics filter you supplied in the date range you provided
e.g: CLICKS = 100 ... DATE_RANGE = LAST_30_DAYS 

--------------------------------------

[Generic Ads Creator]

more about the script: 

this script uses a google sheet as its data supplier and generates adwords ads based on it. 
it supports multiple sheets whereas each sheet represents an ad. 
(attached a sample of the sheet structure) 

it uses labels on campaign level to determine where to add the generated ads. 
each ad includes an adgroup, keywords and ad.

variables: 
at the top of the script you'll find a few variables to set

var DATA_SPREADSHEET = 'AdsCreatorSheet'; // the sheet name
var LABEL_NAME = 'AdsRule'; // only campaign/s labeled with this label will generate this ad
var adGroupDefaultBid = 0.1; // the default bid for the keywords

Q:can I have some more details on your service?

of course 
i write great automation scripts for adwords. the scripts can do almost ANY action  you can do manually. 
the scripts have access to lots of 3rd party services (by google and others) and we can use it to generate reports, maintain an adwords account, send mails, read feeds and do some logic based on them and more and more ... 

an example for a script can be a monitor script which checks for broken ad final url and notifies the account owner before it uses all its budget. 
another good example can be adding a NON PROFIT searches to a negative Keywords,
and there's lots more ...  

let me know if you need any further assistance 

thanks, Roby(-:

I can do that for X usd including .....

find me at rcbuilder at walla.com

hi 
I'm not an SEM guy but a developer who creates great automation scripts (which saves you time and therefore, m-oney). 

you need to dictate to me the process you're doing manually and i will code it into a script which does it automatically for you and based on a schedule time you determine.  

for example: if you find yourself waste too much time on checking broken ads or removing non-converting keywords or any other AdWords-related action - just provide me the steps you do manually and I'll convert it to a running script and you'll never have to waste more time on this process ... 

thanks, Roby (-:
