IIS ISAPI Filters 
=================

* ISAPI :
  - Internet Server API 
  - an API that allows us to extend the funcionality of the IIS core

* ISAPI filters:
  - ISAPI filters are custom code that uses the Internet Server API (ISAPI) to add logic or manipulate the requests and responses
  - ISAPI filters used to extend/modify the funcionallity in the early step of the page cycle. 
  - ISAPI filters are .dll files written in C or C++ .  
  - ISAPI filters can be registered per site or globaly.
  - Every incoming request and outgoing response passes through the filters

* Common uses for ISAPI filters :
  - modify requests url (rewriter etc.)
  - modify requests data
  - filter out unwanted file types 
  - handle redirections (https etc.)
  - control username and passwords used with basic/anonymous authentication
  - modify responses going back to the client 
  - add requests logger or traffic analysis 
  - perform custom authentication
  - encryption 
  - compression

* Recommendation :
  - Microsoft recommends to use modules instead of ISAPI filters
    moreover, ISAPIs written in C or C++ instead of C#

* modules types :
  - there are two modules types that should replace the ISAPIs filter:
    'HTTP Modules' and 'HTTP Handlers'
    the difference between them is that the 'HTTP Handler' executes for a specific requests (by filter) 
    whereas the 'HTTP Module' executes for any request

    e.g: 
	if we want to add some logic to the request pipe line only for .aspx files we should use an 'HTTP Handler' with *.aspx filter. 

* Installation on server 
  - if we don't see the ISAPI filters icon within the IIS, we probably have to install it 
    server manager - Roles and Features - (under IIS) check the ISAPI Filters option

* add isapi filter : 
  - open IIS -> choose the website -> click on ISAPI Filters icon -> Add 
  - set the filter name and its location (.dll)
  - restart website
