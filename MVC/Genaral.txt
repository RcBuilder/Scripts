* MVC = Model View Controller

* MVC 4 uses bundles by default

* when using MVC it's not recommended to use web controls (asp:button etc.) due to the mvc mechanism. 
  use html controls instead!
  there's no .cs attached to the view but a controller.
  the view should not have any logic within it and it should be as pure as it can be.
