## Models ##

General
-------

* models are simply entities we've created (User, Book etc.)

* usually located within 'Models' folder under the project Root.

* use data annotations to define the Entity properties validations (Reuired etc.)

* the 'ModelState.IsValid' represents whether the model is valid or not (based on the model data annotations)

  e.g:
  
  // server 
  [HttpPost]
  public ActionResult Books(Book book) {
	  if(ModelState.IsValid)		  
		return RedirectToAction("Books");
	  else 
		return View();
  }
  
  // client 
  @Html.ValidationSummary()
  ...
  ...
