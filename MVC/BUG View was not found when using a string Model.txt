BUG View was not found when using a string Model
------------------------------------------------

public ActionResult Courses1() {
	return View("Courses", "Courses1");
}


The view 'Courses' or its master was not found or no view engine supports the searched locations. The following locations were searched:
~/Areas/Default/Views/Lp/Courses.aspx
~/Areas/Default/Views/Lp/Courses.ascx
~/Areas/Default/Views/Shared/Courses.aspx
~/Areas/Default/Views/Shared/Courses.ascx
~/Views/Lp/Courses.aspx
~/Views/Lp/Courses.ascx
~/Views/Shared/Courses.aspx
~/Views/Shared/Courses.ascx
~/Areas/Default/Views/Lp/Courses3.master
~/Areas/Default/Views/Shared/Courses3.master
~/Views/Lp/Courses3.master
~/Views/Shared/Courses3.master
~/Areas/Default/Views/Lp/Courses3.cshtml
~/Areas/Default/Views/Lp/Courses3.vbhtml

~/Views/Shared/Courses3.cshtml
~/Views/Shared/Courses3.vbhtml

---

to fix the above issue, just use the correct overload by casting the 
string model as object! to prevent the system to think the 2nd parameter (which represents the model) 
to be the master name which is also a string and uses the same signature!
once we change it into object, it'll use the corrent overload

public ActionResult Courses1() {
            return View("Courses", (object)"Courses1");
        }
        public ActionResult Courses2() {
            return View("Courses", (object)"Courses2");
        }
        public ActionResult Courses3() {
            return View("Courses", (object)"Courses3");
        }

@model string
@switch (Model)
{
    default:
    case "Courses1": @Html.Partial("Partial/Courses1");
        break;
    case "Courses2": @Html.Partial("Partial/Courses2");
        break;
    case "Courses3": @Html.Partial("Partial/Courses3");
        break;    
}
