Single Session Allowed Mechanism
--------------------------------
step-1: 
create a ConnectedSessionsSingleTon class to store references to all connected sessions and their state. (see 'ConnectedSessionsSingleTon')

step-2: 
create an action-filter to serve as a global filter. (see 'HandleSessionStateAttribute')
override the 'OnResultExecuted' method to process the state of the connected sessions on every response.
use the 'ProcessCurrentContext' method of the 'ConnectedSessionsSingleTon' class from step-1

step-3:
add the created filter from step-2 to the global filters table (see 'FilterConfig')

step-4:
register the global filter (see 'Global.asax')
use the 'Application_Start' event.

step-5:
update the connected sessions state on log-in. (see 'Sessions > SetStudent')
mark all previous connected sessions as removed and add the new one.
