launch Network monitor:
Chrome DevTools (F12) > Network (tab)

---

Record Icon:
use it to start/ stop load recording.

Clear Icon:
use it to clear all presented data.

Filter Icon:
see 'Filters'

Search Icon:
use it to search a request in the page load.

Preserve log:
use this option to keep saving requests across page loads. 
when this option is ON, all requests will be saved even when switching pages.
when this option is OFF, any transition to a new page clears the previous data.

Disable Cache:
use this option to disable the browser cache of static requests (css, js, images etc.) 
when this option is ON, no cache is used and the browser will download all files.
this emulates the very first loading of the website.

Offline/ Online:
use this option to simulate an offine and online network. 
when this option is set to 'Offline', the website will be loaded as it has no internet. 
this option also includes a network connection velocity emulator (see 'Network Connection mode')

Capture screenshots:
cog-wheel right icon > Capture screenshots option.
use this option to watch the site view on every stage in the page loading. 
a great tool to find what causes the UI to be blocked on rendering.

Filter by Time:
use the top-time-slider to display which requests was made during a specific time in the page loading.

Use Large rows view:
check the 'Use large request rows' to change the results table to a larger row-view.  
this changes each row within the results table to include extra details without hovering over it (full path, uncompressed size and etc.)


---

Clear Browser Cache:
right click on the main pane > Clear browser cache.

Clear Browser Cookies:
right click on the main pane > Clear browser cookies.

Network Connection mode:
Offline/ Online option > choose connection mode (Online, Offline, Fast, Slow)
use this option to emulate a slow or fast network connection to see how a website is loaded on different connection modes.

Filters:
use this option to filter the loaded requests by properties (domain, status code and etc.)
use the CTRL+SPACE keys (within the Filter input) to set the propery to filter (see 'Filter Properties')
default -> if no property has defined, it searches the 'Name' property.
tip! use CTRL+SPACE again to see available values for each property.
in addition to the search box, there are tags to filter by (see 'Filter Tags')
to hide data urls, there's a 'Hide data URLs' checkbox. data urls are data files that starts with the 'data:' prefix.

Filter Properties:
- larger-than			// in bytes -> larger-than:1000 
- status-code			// status-code:200
- domain				// domain:rcb.co.il
- has-response-header	// has-response-header:Content-Type
- method				// method:POST
- mime-type				// mime-type:font/woff2
- priority				// priority:Highest
- scheme				// scheme:https
- set-cookie-domain		// set-cookie-domain:.google.com
- set-cookie-name
- set-cookie-value
- cookie-domain 		// cookie-domain:.ads.google.com
- cookie-name			// cookie-name:_ga
- cookie-value
tip! we can combine multiple properties (e.g: mime-type:image/png larger-than:500)


Filter Tags:
(aka Filter Types)
- XHR, 
- JS, 
- CSS, 
- Img,
- Media, 
- Font,
- Doc 
- WS
tip! use CTRL to select multi types (e.g: CSS and JS). 

Sort:
click on the required column to switch between ASC and DESC sort types based on the specified column.

Add/ Remove Columns:
right click on any column of the results table > check/ uncheck columns to add/ remove.

Add custom Column:
right click on any column of the results table > Response Headers > Manage Header Columns > Add Custom Header.

View Initiators and Dependencies:
SHIFT (hold) + hover a request in the results table.
the first green-painted row above the active one (the row we're hovering over) is the initiator, each green row above it is the initiator of the initiator and so on...
any red-painted row underneath the active one is a dependency of it, meaning the active row initiated it.

load events viewer:
beneath the results table, we can find a summary-like row with final loading metrics. 
- X requests		// how many requests were made as part of the page loading process 
- X transferred		// how many MB were transferred (downloaded)
- X resources		// how many MB were transferred (downloaded) after the browser uncompressed all resources.
- Finish			// how long to finish processing the entire request 
- DOMContentLoaded	// how long to load the DOM 
- Load				// how long to load the page

Resource uncompressed size:
once the browser completes downloading a compressed file, it uncompressed them.
to view the uncompressed size of a resource, we need to hover it's Size (under the Size column). 

Export results table:
right click on the results table > Save as HAR with Content
tip! to import an .har file, drag-drop it into the area of the results table.

Waterfall:
a visual breakdown of each request's activity.
use it to view the timing of requests in relation to one another (parallelism)
use it to view how much time each request has taken, how long it has waited or has been stalled.
use it to view when each request has been started in the loading process (from left to right)
to analyze a timing breakdown of a request see 'Waterfall - Analyze Timing Breakdown' 

Waterfall - Analyze Timing Breakdown:
- Queueing		
  for how long the request was queued. 
  a request is queued when there are more than X connections open per origin or when there are higher priority requests.

- Stalled
  for how long the request was stalled.
  same reasons as queueing.

- DNS Lookup
  how long it took to resolve the IP address. 

- Initial connection
  how long it took to establish a connection (TCP handshakes etc.)

- Proxy negotiation
  how long it took to establish a connection to a proxy server.

- Request sent
  how long it took to send the request.

- Waiting (TTFB)
  Time To First Byte
  for how long the browser was waiting for the first byte of a response.
  the actual server-side processing. 

- Content Download
  how long it took to download the content.


Request Details:
to view an information about a specific request, choose a request > a new pane will appear with all the relevant details about the selected row.
we can find details about the following 
- Request (type, cookies, headers, query Parameters, payload etc.) 
- Response (type, cookies, headers etc.) 
- Response Body
- Response Preview 
- Timing (from the waterfall)
- Frames (for webSockets)
tip! we can also switch between 'source' and 'encoded' modes for 'Form Data' and 'Query Parameters'
