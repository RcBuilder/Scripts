what is Visual Studio Code? 
---------------------------
a lightweight source code Editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux!
VS Code is an open source project.

Support
-------
Visual Studio Code has a built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js
and a lot of extensions for other languages (C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, NativeScript etc.)

Keyboard Shortcuts
------------------
shortcuts:
- File > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts
- https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf

edit:
we can change each shortcut to be any keyboard combination we'd like! 
- open 'Visual Studio Code' Editor
- use the Edit icon to the left of each defined shortcut
- set a new shortcut

note:
the shortcuts map is saved to the keybindings.json file and can be managed from there as well.

keymap Extensions:
- File > Preferences > Keymap Extensions // list of popular keymap extensions
- allow us to Use the keyboard shortcuts of other editors in VS Code by installing a Keymap extension.
  a great feature which allows us to use our familiar shortcuts from our old editor instead of learn new shortcuts!

tip: we can search the extensions for more keymaps (see 'Manage Extensions')

Manage Extensions
-----------------
we can add extensions via the Editor or the Market 
for some common extensions see 'Extensions' 

Editor:
- open the 'Visual Studio Code' Editor  
- Settings Icon (the left-bottom cog-wheel)
  note: can use View > Extensions
- Manage Extensions
- Search for the desired extension > install 

- note
  Extensions represents the content of the market place, 
  so each search actually performs a search on the market from within the editor!

- tip
  we can reach the Extensions manager from the left menu (see 'Working With VS Code')
  we can reach it using the Ctrl + Shift + X shortcut

Market:
see 'Market' 

Working With VS Code
--------------------
activity bar:
at the left, we have a stripe menu with the following items:
- File Explorer
- Search 
- Source Code
- Debug 
- Extensions

shortcuts:
- all commands list
  Ctrl + Shift + P 

- go to file
  Ctrl + P 

- find in files
  Ctrl + Shift + F

- view Extensions
  Ctrl + Shift + X

- start debugging
  F5

Themes:
- open 'all commands list' (Ctrl + Shift + P) 
- search per 'color theme'
- choose a theme from the list

Settings:
we can set the editor settings using the UI 
Ctrl + Shift + P > Settings 

or in json view 
Ctrl + Shift + P > Settings (JSON)

at the left pane we'll find the default settings whereas in the right it's our customization.
we can override each of the default pre-defined settings (left pane) and even specifies a language-specific settings.

MS Syntax
VS Code comes with a built-in MS-syntax feature. 
depending on the page type we are in, we get a powerful tool which makes our coding better and easier. 

e.g: for html type
write '!' and then click on 'tab' to generate a basic html page template
write tag name (h1 etc.) then 'tab' to create an html tag with it's enclosing tag (<h1></h1>)
write 'link' then 'tab' to get a link tag to a css file.
