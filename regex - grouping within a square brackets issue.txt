regex grouping within a square brackets issue
-------------------- ------------------------

input:
Description
lorem ipsum 1986 some content

pattern:
\d{4} (?! \s+ [x(abs)])

result:
no match!!

reason:
grouping not supported within a square brackets! being referred as characters 

the rule-part [x(abs)] is translated into [xabs]
so the actual meaning of the rule is as follow:
four digis, then a space and then any sequential character which is NOT x, a, b or s!
